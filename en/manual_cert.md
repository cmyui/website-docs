### Manually installing our SSL Certificate

This means that your hosts file has most likely successfully been redirected via the hosts file, but your certificate is somehow not working. Please check https://c.ppy.sh/ and refer to the possibilities below:

A. Page unsafe warning
Fix: This means the certificate is infact invalid/not working. If this happens, please install the following certificate: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/365413867167285249/405173894186663947/ca.crt,
as this gif does:

B. osu!Bancho page
Fix: This means your hosts file actually was not written, or redirection is not working in some way, but somehow your osu! is still being redirected? Move to #help.
